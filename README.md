# Dijkstra_Routing_Algorithim-ECE471-
In networks, a node needs to find out the shortest path to the rest in the same network.<br>
The weightsassociated with links are also referred as costs. <br>
In this project, it is simply the distance. <br>
Dijkstra’s algorithm is commonly used to serve this purpose for network routing, Google Maps and shortest path for robotics. <br> <br>
Included is project report, matlab code and output image.<br>
