# Dijkstra_Routing_Algorithim-ECE471-
In networks, a node needs to find out the shortest path to the rest in the same network.<br>
The weightsassociated with links are also referred as costs. <br>
In this project, it is simply the distance. <br>
Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm is commonly used to serve this purpose for network routing, Google Maps and shortest path for robotics. <br> <br>
Included is project report, matlab code and output image.<br>
_V2 is the file with the optimized more efficient code however the main one works as intended for project and v2 takes it a **step further**_
